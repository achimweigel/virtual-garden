# Virtual Garden Landscaper Component for [Gardener](https://gardener.cloud)

ðŸš§ This repository is heavily under construction and should be considered experimental.

This repository contains the implementation to deploy the virtual garden, consisting basically of two etcd's, a
kube apiserver, and kube controller manager.

There are two alternatives for the deployment:

- [executing a make target](./docs/deploy-virtual-garden-with-make-target.md),

- [deploying with Landscaper](./docs/deploy-virtual-garden-with-landscaper.md).

## Local Development

Please consider reading [this document](docs/local-development.md).
